# Minesweeper-2.0
### Project summary
This project is an attempt to create an open-source game inspired in the classic
windows Minesweeper game. The goal is to develop a simple but creative game, as
well as to learn through the process.

### Mechanics
Here is a list of all the new concepts / mechanics that we'll be adding to the
classical version of the game:
 - Extra lives: the player will be able to get extra lives during the game
 - Anti-bombs: these will subtract 1 to the tile next to them, complicating the
 gameplay substantially
 - TBD

### Dependencies
 - numpy 1.22.4
